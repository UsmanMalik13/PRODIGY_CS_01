# PRODIGY_CS_01

A Python implementation of Caesar Cipher for encryption and decryption.

## Overview
This project is a simple and effective Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the earliest and most basic encryption techniques. The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift key.

### How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter of the input text by a certain number (the shift key), effectively encoding or decoding the message based on whether the user wants to encrypt or decrypt.

### Features
- **Encryption**: Input plain text and a shift key (1-26) to encrypt the message.
- **Decryption**: Input an encrypted message and the same shift key to retrieve the original text.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserves spaces and special characters as is.

### How to Use

1. **Encryption Mode**:
   - The user inputs a message and selects a shift key.
   - The program encrypts the message based on the shift and displays the ciphertext.

2. **Decryption Mode**:
   - The user provides an encrypted message and the original shift key.
   - The program decrypts the message and displays the original plaintext.

### Prerequisites

Make sure Python is installed on your system to run the script.

### Running the Program

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UsmanMalik13/Caesar-Cipher.git
